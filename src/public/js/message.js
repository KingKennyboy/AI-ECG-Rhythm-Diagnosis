    { name: "SR", note: "This is a normal rhythm of the heart named Sinus Rhythm.", description: "sinus rhythm is defined as the rhythm of a healthy heart. It means the electrical pulse from your sinus node is being properly transmitted throughout the heart muscle." },
    { name: "SND", note: "SND, or Sinus Node Dysfunction, is a condition involving irregularities in the heart's primary pacemaker.", description: "Sinus Node Dysfunction is characterized by the failure of the sinus node to maintain an appropriate heart rate for bodily functions, either due to slowing down or pausing (sinus pauses or sinus arrest). This can lead to symptoms like fatigue, dizziness, or fainting, especially in elderly patients." },
    { name: "AT", note: "Atrial Tachycardia is an abnormal heart rhythm originating from the upper chambers of the heart.", description: "Atrial Tachycardia involves a series of early beats in the atria. It can cause the heart to beat faster than normal, but not as rapidly or irregularly as seen in atrial fibrillation. It often feels like a sudden burst of rapid heartbeats." },
    { name: "SA", note: "a kind of arrhythmia (abnormal heart rhythm)", description: "An arrhythmia, or irregular heartbeat, is a problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat. Your heart may beat too quickly, too slowly, or with an irregular rhythm" }
